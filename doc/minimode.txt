MINIMODES                                                            *minimodes*
==============================================================================

This plugin provides a method for quickly and cleanly switching between groups
of mappings, autocmds, and abbreviations.


:Minimode {name} [{index}]                                           *:Minimode*
==============================================================================

Conceptually a minimode is a tuple (usually just a pair) of blocks of
commands, one for each state of the minimode. |:Minimode| switches beteeen these
states, running the commands in the {index}th block of minimode {name}. If
{index} is not provided then |:Minimode| will switch into and out of state 0.

In addition (before the activation is run) |:Minimode| will clean up the
currently active state: `unmap` mappings, clear autocmds, and `unabbrev` abbrevs.

All minimodes begin in state 0.


:MinimodeDefine[!] {name} {activations}                        *:MinimodeDefine*
==============================================================================

Minimodes are defined with lists of commands for setting up its possible
states. Deactivations are automatically generated.

For example one way to allow for rapid movement between splits and tabs
would be:
>
    MinimodeDefine InterBuffer '
      \----
      \    nnoremap N :Minimode InterBuffer<CR>
      \
      \----
      \    nnoremap <Space> :Minimode InterBuffer<CR>
      \    nnoremap h <C-w>h
      \    nnoremap j <C-w>j
      \    nnoremap k <C-w>k
      \    nnoremap l <C-w>l
      \    nnoremap y :tabprev<CR>
      \    nnoremap u :tabnext<CR>
      \'
<
`N` (the only mapping active by default) will put `InterBuffer` into state 1
where `hjkl` will allow no-modifier navigation between splits. These mappings
can be dismissed with `<Space>` to return to normal in-buffer navigation.

WARNING: minimodes will clobber mappings they are not aware of, so if you need
something mapped by default it needs to go in the default activation list for
the minimode which would clobber it.

WARNING: minimodes do not support shortening command names. In ex mode
`nm ,f :Foo<CR>` can be substituted for `nmap ,f :Foo<CR>` but minimode fails to
recognize it and will not add the appropriate `unmap ,f` to the minimode's
deactivation commands.

NOTE: |Minimode_indentblocksplit| for more information about this long string.
|:MinimodeDefine| can also accept a list of list of executable strings as
its second argument. If you want to define a minimode programatically, it
might be easier to use that.


Hooking deactivation                                 *Minimode_deactivation_for*
==============================================================================

If you need to hook deactivation for a custom command you can do so by adding
an entry to |Minimode_deactivation_for|. The entry must be a function taking
the arguments to your command as a single string and returning a corresponding
deactivation command. For example:
>
    function Minimode_deactivation_for.Thingify(args)
      return 'UnThingify ' . matchlist(a:args, '(foo|bar)')[1]
    endfunction
<
There are default deactivations for:

- `(n|v|x|s|o|i|l|c|t|)(nore|)map(!?)`, with support for |:map-arguments|
- `(c|i|)abbrev` and `abbreviate`, with support for `<expr>` and `<buffer>`
- `autocmd`; each minimode declares a like-named `augroup` which it clears
  and repopulates each time the minimode is reactivated.


Multiline strings               *Minimode_indentsplit* *Minimode_indentblocksplit*
==============================================================================

Python has `"""` strings, which is a feature I miss like an appendage whenever a
language doesn't support it. Vimscript allows writing strings which span
multiple lines but it doesn't capture newlines, so we have to infer where
to break the lines. In idiomatic Vimscript, when writing multiline strings one
indents a ways from the `\` for clarity, and |Minimode_indentsplit| relies on
that to insert your line breaks: lots of leading whitespace is assumed to be
an indent, and it is replaced with line breaks.
>
    AssertEqual ['a', 'b c'], Minimode_indentblocksplit('
      \    a
      \    b c
      \'
<
|Minimode_indentblocksplit| takes this a bit further and allows you to define
section dividers:
>
    AssertEqual [['a', 'b c'], ['d', 'e f']], Minimode_indentblocksplit('
      \----
      \    a
      \    b c
      \
      \----
      \    d
      \    e f
      \'
<
WARNING: This is a brutal dirty hack. Among other restrictions, you need to
make sure that the indent doesn't appear anywhere else in your string
(otherwise it will be interpreted as a line break). Beware: aligning
columns inside your string may produce incorrect lines!
>
    let not_the_lines_I_ordered = ['nmap <C-t> :T<CR>', 'nmap t', ' :T!<CR>']
    AssertEqual not_the_lines_I_ordered, Minimode_indentblocksplit('
      \    nmap <C-t> :T<CR>
      \    nmap t     :T!<CR>
      \'
<
